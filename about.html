            <h2>Understanding Celsius and Fahrenheit</h2>
            <p>Celsius and Fahrenheit are two widely used temperature scales. The Celsius scale, commonly used worldwide, is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, with 0°C as the freezing point and 100°C as the boiling point. Fahrenheit, more common in the United States, defines 32°F as the freezing point of water and 212°F as the boiling point.</p>
            <p>The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is: <code>(C × 9/5) + 32</code>.</p>
